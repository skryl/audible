  "gender": "Female",
  "age": "Not explicitly stated, but she is portrayed as younger than her husband and full of desperate vitality, likely in her late 20s or early 30s",
  "description": "Myrtle is the embodiment of longing and desperation. Living on the fringes of the upper-class world she aspires to, she is both sensuous and rough around the edges. Her presence is charged with a restless, almost tragic energy.",
  "personality": "Myrtle is impulsive, resentful, and emotionally volatile. She is prone to outbursts and exudes a desperate need for validation and escape from her unsatisfactory life. Her behavior oscillates between flirtatious flirtation and bitter frustration, revealing a deep-seated insecurity and envy.",
  "voice": "Her voice carries a raw, sometimes shrill quality that betrays both her fervent longing and her lower social status. It can quickly shift in tone\u2014from seductive attempts to draw attention, to expressions of terror and jealousy\u2014making it one of the most emotionally explosive among the characters.",
  "appearance": "Myrtle\u2019s physical appearance is less refined than that of the Buchanans. She is depicted as having a somewhat garish style, with clothes that attempt to mimic an upper-class elegance but end up clashing with her background. Her expressions, especially moments of 'jealous terror', foreground her inner tumult, and her appearance is marked by a certain coarseness that contrasts sharply with the delicacy of characters like Daisy.",
