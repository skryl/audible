  "description": "Gatsby is the wealthy, enigmatic figure whose extravagant lifestyle masks deep vulnerability and longing. In this chapter, his focus on Daisy and his evident emotional turbulence underscore the contradictions of his persona.",
  "personality": "Charismatic and passionate, Gatsby is both hopeful and desperate. His idealism, revealed in phrases like \u2018old sport\u2019 and his fixation on his past with Daisy, contrasts with moments of nervous tension. There is an earnest, almost childlike fixation on his dreams, yet he remains guarded and prone to emotional outbursts when challenged.",
  "voice": "Gatsby\u2019s voice carries a polished, affected elegance. He often uses the term \u2018old sport\u2019 as an affectation that lends his speech a slightly archaic, cultivated air. His tone can shift from soft, dreamy intimations when speaking of Daisy to a clear, determined cadence when defending his self-worth.",
  "appearance": "Noted for his dapper style, Gatsby is depicted in a striking manner \u2013 his choice of a pink suit in the heat subtly underscores his willingness to stand out. He is impeccably dressed in a way that reflects both wealth and an almost theatrical attention to detail, his appearance both alluring and meticulously maintained.",
