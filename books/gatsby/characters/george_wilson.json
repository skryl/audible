  "description": "George is a downtrodden, exhausted man whose life of hard labor and quiet misery is sharply contrasted with the opulence of those around him. He is marked by a deep-seated vulnerability and a sense of hopeless resignation.",
  "personality": "Timid, worn out, and painfully sincere, George comes off as the epitome of a man beaten down by circumstance. His mannerisms reveal a deep sense of defeat and an acute distress over his failing situation, yet there is an honest, unpretentious quality about him that contrasts with the extravagant behaviors of others.",
  "voice": "George\u2019s voice is likely soft, trembling, and tentative. It carries the weary cadence of someone burdened by life\u2019s hardships, marked by a lack of assertiveness and a habit of speaking in a measured, almost subdued tone.",
  "appearance": "Described as pale, sick, and physically frail, George\u2019s appearance is that of a man whose vitality has long been sapped by a life of constant labor and disappointment. His eyes and overall demeanor reflect a tired spirit, and his dress and grooming suggest a man who is far removed from the polished appearance of the affluent characters around him.",
