You may fool me, but you can\u2019t fool God!' Behind him, as if in silent witness, the enormous, dissolving eyes of Doctor T. J.

Gatsby, donning his bathing suit at two o'clock, left strict instructions with the butler regarding the pool while he retrieved a pneumatic mattress to amuse his guests during the summer. With the chauffeur\u2019s help and under a canopy of yellowing trees, he disappeared among the branches. Minutes later, as a few distant shots were heard, I rushed up the front steps, and soon a small party, including the chauffeur, butler, and gardener, descended to the pool. There, in a final, almost imperceptible movement of water, the mattress drifted\u2014and it was then that the gardener discovered Wilson\u2019s body on the grass. In that heart-wrenching moment, the holocaust was complete.",
