Two o\u2019clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light that fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin, elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner, I saw that it was Gatsby\u2019s house \u2013 lit from tower to cellar. For a fleeting moment I suspected a wild party was underway, but there wasn\u2019t a sound \u2013 only the wind whispering in the trees and making the lights wink in and out of darkness. As my taxi groaned away, I caught sight of Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.",

Gatsby retreated into a shadowed corner while Daisy and I talked, our eyes occasionally meeting his with a mix of tension and unspoken hope. At the first opportunity I excused myself. 'Where are you going?' Gatsby demanded in immediate alarm. 'I\u2019ll be back,' I replied, only to be interrupted by his urgent whisper in the kitchen: 'Oh, God! This is a terrible mistake, a terrible, terrible mistake.' I tried to soothe him, remarking that perhaps he was merely embarrassed \u2013 just as Daisy was.",
