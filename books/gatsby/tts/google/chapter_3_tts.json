At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or sunning themselves on his beach while motorboats sliced through the Sound. Weekends saw his Rolls\u2010Royce transforming into an omnibus and his station wagon darting to meet arriving trains. And on Mondays eight servants worked all day, restoring the ravages of the night before. Every Friday crates of oranges and lemons arrived from New York, only to be transformed into pulpless halves by a kitchen machine at the press of a butler\u2019s thumb. At least once a fortnight, a team of caterers would descend with canvases and colored lights to transform Gatsby\u2019s enormous garden into a surreal, festive world. Buffet tables overflowed with hors d\u2019oeuvre, hams, salads, and pastries, and the hall\u2019s brass rail bar overflowed with gins, liquors and curios cordials. By seven o\u2019clock the full orchestra arrived\u2014an entire pit of woodwinds, brass, drums and strings\u2014and soon the garden became a riotous swirl of primary colors, modern haircuts, extravagant shawls, and a constant chatter of introductions and innuendo. As twilight deepened, the orchestra shifted to yellow cocktail music and voices pitched a key higher; laughter, light chatter, and the excited mingling of confident wanderers marked the birth of the party.",

At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or sunning themselves on his beach while motorboats sliced through the Sound. Weekends saw his Rolls\u2010Royce transforming into an omnibus and his station wagon darting to meet arriving trains. And on Mondays eight servants worked all day, restoring the ravages of the night before. Every Friday crates of oranges and lemons arrived from New York, only to be transformed into pulpless halves by a kitchen machine at the press of a butler\u2019s thumb. At least once a fortnight, a team of caterers would descend with canvases and colored lights to transform Gatsby\u2019s enormous garden into a surreal, festive world. Buffet tables overflowed with hors d\u2019oeuvre, hams, salads, and pastries, and the hall\u2019s brass rail bar overflowed with gins, liquors and curios cordials. By seven o\u2019clock the full orchestra arrived\u2014an entire pit of woodwinds, brass, drums and strings\u2014and soon the garden became a riotous swirl of primary colors, modern haircuts, extravagant shawls, and a constant chatter of introductions and innuendo. As twilight deepened, the orchestra shifted to yellow cocktail music and voices pitched a key higher; laughter, light chatter, and the excited mingling of confident wanderers marked the birth of the party.",
