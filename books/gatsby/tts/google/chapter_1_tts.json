He didn\u2019t say any more, but we\u2019d always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood there was a deeper meaning behind his words. This advice, along with many experiences\u2014including my college days when I was accused of being a politician for keeping my judgments reserved\u2014shaped my outlook on people and life. I learned that reserving judgment is a matter of infinite hope; yet, as life goes on, even tolerance has its limits. In all these musings, one figure stands apart: Gatsby, the enigmatic man who represented for me both an extraordinary gift for hope and the inexorable corruption left by dreams.",
