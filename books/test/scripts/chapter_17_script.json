His mind circled around the words Lord Henry had once told him: \u201cTo cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul.\u201d Those words resonated in him as he considered the possibility of oblivion through hedonism, even as opium dens promised temporary escape and the destruction of old sins."

At one point, lost in a labyrinth of dripping puddles and swirling mist, Dorian\u2019s mounting hunger for opium turned into agitation. His throat burned and his delicate hands trembled. In his fury he struck at the horse with his stick, urging the hansom driver, whose raucous laughter filled the cab, to speed on through a night that seemed to stretch endlessly into foreboding darkness."

After a peculiar knock and the quiet unhooking of a chain, he entered a long, low room that resembled a third-rate dancing saloon. Gas-jets, distorted in reflectors of ribbed tin and mounted on faded walls, cast quivering disks of light over a floor stained with ochre sawdust and spilled liquor. Here, Malays clustered around a charcoal stove, a sailor slumped over a table, and two haggard women mocked an old man\u2014all contributing to a tableau of grotesque despair."
