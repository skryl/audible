But I wish you had left word where you had really gone to. I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy might be followed by another. I think you might have telegraphed for me when you heard of it first. I read of it quite by chance in a late edition of The Globe that I picked up at the club. I came here at once and was miserable at not finding you. I can\u2019t tell you how heart-broken I am about the whole thing. I know what you must suffer. But where were you? Did you go down and see the girl\u2019s mother? For a moment I thought of following you there. They gave the address in the paper. Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn\u2019t it? But I was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten. Poor woman! What a state she must be in! And her only child, too! What did she say about it all?",

She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang divinely. Don\u2019t talk about horrid subjects. If one doesn\u2019t talk about a thing, it has never happened. It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives reality to things. I may mention that she was not the woman\u2019s only child. There is a son, a charming fellow, I believe.

You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream. I worshipped you. I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke. I wanted to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with you. When you were away from me, you were still present in my art.... I have tried to capture your perfection in myth and allegory\u2014a Paris in dainty armour, an Adonis with a huntsman\u2019s cloak, even as you sat crowned with lotus-blossoms upon a barge drifting on the green Nile. But one day, a fatal day I sometimes think, I resolved to paint you as you truly are, not in costume of dead ages, but in your own dress and time. As I worked on it, every shade of colour revealed my secret. I became afraid; I felt I had bet too much of myself on your beauty. I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited.
