Dorian Gray was walking home about eleven o\u2019clock from Lord Henry\u2019s, having dined in the warm atmosphere of a gentleman\u2019s club. Wrapped in heavy furs against the cold, foggy night, he ambled along the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street. Through the mist he noticed a man, hurrying past with the collar of his grey ulster turned up and a bag in his hand\u2014a man Dorian recognized as Basil Hallward. A strange, inexplicable fear seized him, and without a sign of recognition he quickened his pace toward his house.",
