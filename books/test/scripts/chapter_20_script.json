Well, Hetty was not one of our own class, of course. She was simply a girl in a village. But I really loved her. I am quite sure that I loved her. All during this wonderful May that we have been having, I used to run down and see her two or three times a week. Yesterday she met me in a little orchard. The apple-blossoms kept tumbling down on her hair, and she was laughing. We were to have gone away together this morning at dawn.

Yes, I should fancy that was his end. I see him lying now on his back under those dull-green waters, with heavy barges floating above and long weeds catching in his hair.

You never got it back? What a pity! It was really a masterpiece. I remember I wanted to buy it. I wish I had now. It belonged to Basil\u2019s best period.

A wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful phrase flung into the air by shrill, hysterical lips\u2014it was really very good in its way, quite a suggestion.

Don\u2019t be so serious. What have you or I to do with the superstitions of our age? No: we have given up our belief in the soul. Play me something. Play me a nocturne, Dorian, and, as you play, tell me in a low voice how you have kept your youth. You must have some secret. I am only ten years older than you are, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow. You are really wonderful, Dorian. You have never looked more charming than you do tonight. You remind me of the day I saw you first. You were rather cheeky, very shy, and absolutely extraordinary. You have changed, of course, but not in appearance. I wish you would tell me your secret.

The only people whose opinions I listen to now with any respect are people much younger than myself. They seem to be right in front of me. Life has revealed to them her latest wonder. As for the aged, I always contradict the aged. I do it on principle. If you ask them their opinion on something that happened yesterday, they solemnly give you the opinions current in 1820, when people wore high stocks, believed in everything, and knew absolutely nothing. How lovely that thing you are playing is! I wonder, did Chopin write it at Majorca, with the sea weeping round the villa and the salt spray dashing against the panes? It is marvellously romantic. What a blessing that there is one art left to us that is not imitative! Don\u2019t stop. I want music tonight. It seems to me that you are the young Apollo and that I am Marsyas listening to you. I have sorrows, Dorian, of my own, that even you know nothing of. The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young. I am sometimes amazed at my own sincerity. Ah, Dorian, how happy you are! What an exquisite life you have had! You have drunk deeply of everything. You have crushed the grapes against your palate. Nothing has been hidden from you.

You are too delightful for that. Besides, it is no use. You and I are what we are and will always be. As for being poisoned by a book, there is no such thing. Art has no influence upon action\u2014it annihilates the desire to act. It is superbly sterile. The books the world calls immoral expose its own shame. That\u2019s all. But let\u2019s not discuss literature. Come round tomorrow: I\u2019m riding at eleven. We might even go together, and I\u2019ll take you to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome\u2014a charming woman who wants your opinion on some tapestries she\u2019s considering buying. Mind you come. Or shall we lunch with our little duchess? She says she never sees you these days. Perhaps you are tired of Gladys? I thought you would be. Her clever tongue gets on one\u2019s nerves.
