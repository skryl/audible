Around them, the tea-time gathering unfolded: the Duchess presided over the service with her daintily moving white hands and full red lips, smiling at a whispered remark from Dorian. Lord Henry lounged in a silk-draped wicker chair, equally amused by the scene, while on a peach-coloured divan sat Lady Narborough, feigning interest in the duke\u2019s description of a newly acquired Brazilian beetle. A few young men in elaborate smoking-suits passed tea-cakes among the guests, and the air was ripe with anticipation for more arrivals the next day.",

It was a marvellous spotted thing, as effective as the seven deadly sins. In a thoughtless moment I asked one of the gardeners what it was called, and he told me it was a fine specimen of Robinsoniana\u2014or something dreadful of that kind. It is a sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things. Names are everything. I never quarrel with actions. My one quarrel is with words. That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in literature. The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one. It is the only thing he is fit for.",
