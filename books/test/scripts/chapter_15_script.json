      "text": "At nine o\u2019clock the next morning, Dorian Gray sleeps peacefully as his devoted servant enters with a tray of chocolate and opens the shutters. The mellow November sun streams into the room and transforms the early morning into something almost as genial as a May day. Dorian lies on his right side with one hand under his cheek, looking like a boy spent with play or study."

      "text": "The servant must tap him twice on the shoulder before Dorian awakens. As his eyes flutter open, a faint, almost imperceptible smile plays across his lips\u2014as if he had been lost in a delightful dream. Yet his sleep had been free from visions of pleasure or pain; such is the random charm of youth."

      "text": "After slowly turning and leaning on his elbow to sip his chocolate, Dorian\u2019s mind begins to reconstruct the events of the previous night. Gradually, images of horror\u2014of blood and suffering, and a deep loathing for Basil Hallward\u2014creep back. But he forces himself to dismiss these recollections, knowing some sins are best banished from memory."

      "text": "Once half an hour has passed, Dorian hastily moves to dress. Every detail is attended to: the perfect necktie, the precise placement of his rings, and even his tastefully arranged breakfast. Amid letters that provoke both smiles and vexation\u2014as one is even torn up with a quiet remark reminiscent of Lord Henry\u2019s disparaging comment about a woman\u2019s memory\u2014Dorian projects an air of refined composure."

He lights a cigarette and begins to sketch on a piece of paper\u2014first delicate flowers and hints of architecture, then human faces. With mounting disquiet, he notices that every face he draws holds a disturbing resemblance to Basil Hallward. In an effort to exile these thoughts, he selects a volume by Gautier from the book-case."

He paces his room like a beautiful caged creature, aware that every tick of the clock drags him inexorably towards a grim confrontation. Once, a great friendship had flourished with Alan Campbell\u2014a man of science whose passion for experimentation balanced his strict reserve. Now, with every measuring second, Dorian\u2019s apprehension mounts in anticipation of Alan\u2019s arrival."

As he hesitantly gathers the gold-and-purple hanging and flings it over the canvas, Dorian\u2019s inner turmoil is left echoing in that final, abhorrent act."
