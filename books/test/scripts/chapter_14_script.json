Basil glances around as the room reveals signs of neglect \u2013 a faded Flemish tapestry, a curtained picture, an old Italian cassone, an almost empty book-case, a solitary chair and table, dust covering every surface, holes in the carpet, and even a mouse scurrying behind the wainscoting.

Basil flails violently\u2014a stifled groan, convulsive arms, and the sickening sound of blood choking the air.
