      "text": "For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of a mysterious book. In fact, he never sought to free himself at all. He acquired nine large-paper copies of its first edition from Paris, binding each in a different color to match his changing moods. The book, to him, wasn\u2019t merely written \u2013 it was his life foretold, a dark mirror reflecting his inner self.",
      "voice_traits": "Calm, reflective, with a measured pacing and a hint of melancholy. The narrator\u2019s accent is refined and understated, with deliberate pauses to emphasize the gravity of the text.",

      "text": "The enigmatic hero of the novel, that brilliant Parisian whose romantic and scientific spirits intermingled, became, in Dorian\u2019s eyes, a prefigured version of himself. Unlike that literary character, though, Dorian never suffered from the grotesque dread of mirrors and reflections. Instead, a cruel pleasure arose in reading the tragic latter chapters, where sorrow intermingled with despair \u2013 emotions that resonated deeply with his own secret inner decay.",
      "voice_traits": "Measured and evocative, with a slight rising intonation on words such as 'tragic' and 'despair'. The pacing is deliberate, inviting the listener to visualize each detail.",

His effortless charm recalled the innocence long lost by others, and many saw in him the embodiment of the ideal \u2013 the perfect blend of cultured intellect and worldly grace.",
      "voice_traits": "Eloquent, with refined articulation. A hint of admiration and wistfulness colors the delivery, punctuated by soft pauses to draw attention to key phrases like 'purity of his face' and 'worldly grace.'",

With the key that never left his side, he would open the door and confront two images: the evil, aging face in Basil Hallward\u2019s portrait, and the youthful, laughing reflection in the mirror. The stark contrast stirred in him a monstrous delight \u2013 a perverse pleasure in both his beauty and the corruption of his soul.",
      "voice_traits": "Dark, introspective, with an undercurrent of irony. The tone shifts from observational to intensely personal, slowing the pace during the description of the dual reflections.",

His insatiable curiosity for life, first ignited by the provocative Lord Henry, only grew into ravenous hungers for new sensations.",

Regular winter soirees at his magnificent house showcased celebrated musicians, exotic flowers, embroidered cloths, and antique gold- and silver-hued plates.

In concerts held in a room adorned with vermilion-and-gold ceilings, he listened raptly as gipsies, Tunisians, Negroes, and Indians unleashed wild, discordant melodies that stirred him as deeply as the sublime harmonies of Beethoven or Chopin.",

He meticulously collected precious stones \u2013 emeralds, turquoises, topazes \u2013 each with its own storied provenance from ancient legends to historical curiosities. Luxury, decadence, and the history of art mingled in his private collection like a tapestry woven from the splendors of forgotten empires.",

Hung on the wall of his private retreat, it chronicled the true degradation of his life. At times, after a night of reckless indulgence, Dorian would return from the world\u2019s bright stage, rush to the locked room, and gaze at the painting with a mixture of horror and perverse pleasure. He would laugh bitterly, mocking the hideous features that the canvas betrayed \u2013 a burden, yet a secret source of his individuality.",

Whispers followed him in elite clubs and shadowed corners \u2013 tales of unsavory nights in seedy dens, of brawls with sailors, of mysterious absences.
