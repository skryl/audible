The constant, oppressive sensation of being hunted, snared, and tracked down gripped him. Every insignificant movement\u2014a trembling tapestry in the wind or dead leaves pressed against the leaded panes\u2014became, in his fevered mind, the manifestation of his missed resolutions and bitter regrets. When he closed his eyes, the image of the sailor\u2019s face peered through the mist-stained glass, and horror clutched his heart once more.",

In his mind, justice was vivid and logical; remorse gave sinister life to the shadows of sin. In the reality of facts, no stranger had stalked his grounds, no footprints disturbed the flower-beds, and Sibyl Vane\u2019s brother was not returning to exact revenge. He had sailed away, never to be recognized. But the thought alone\u2014that his conscience could summon such dreadful illusions\u2014made him shudder. The terror lay not in the act itself, but in the haunting possibility that every silent corner might harbor the specter of his crime, mocking him at the feast or awakening him with icy fingers in the night.",

Soon, he drove across the park to join a shooting party.
