  "gender": "Male",
  "age": "Young man, possibly in his twenties (as inferred from his Cambridge days and intellectual pursuits)",
  "description": "Alan Campbell is an exceptionally intelligent and scientifically minded individual who once shared a close friendship with Dorian Gray. A man of precision and discipline, he is more comfortable in a laboratory than in high society.",
  "personality": "Alan is characterized by a cool, pragmatic, and deliberate disposition. He is analytical and somewhat detached when it comes to the gruesome realities of his scientific work, yet his inner sensitivity surfaces when forced to confront moral dilemmas. While his earlier friendship with Dorian suggests warmth once existed between them, his current interactions are marked by a stern, uncompromising attitude and a palpable sense of moral revulsion at Dorian\u2019s actions.",
  "voice": "Alan\u2019s speech is described as hard, cold, and measured. His tone reflects his scientific background and a deliberate, thoughtful manner of speaking. There is an underlying formality and clarity, accented perhaps by an academic or upper-class English accent, which adds to the impression of a man who values logic and reason above all else.",
  "appearance": "Alan is noted for his pallor and dark features, with coal-black hair and dark eyebrows that emphasize his severe expression. His choice of clothing, including his Astrakhan coat, underlines both his practical nature and refined taste. His overall appearance is that of a serious, somewhat ascetic young man, whose physical demeanor\u2014marked by nervous shivering when under stress\u2014mirrors the internal tension between his scientific detachment and personal integrity.",
