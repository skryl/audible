  "description": "Jim is a robust young man with a rough-hewn demeanor and a cautious, protective nature. He is noticeably less refined than his sister, both in his appearance and in his outlook on life, which is shaped by simplicity and a touch of defiant resilience.",
  "personality": "Practical, direct, and sometimes sulky, Jim displays a mix of youthful stubbornness and deep caring\u2014especially when it comes to the well-being of his sister. His protective instincts border on possessiveness, and he is quick to express anger and jealousy, particularly regarding the idealized Prince Charming who has captured Sibyl's heart.",
  "voice": "Jim\u2019s voice is characterized by a coarse, somewhat low tone that reflects his straightforward nature. It is less affected than his sister\u2019s, carrying the gruffness of someone accustomed to the hard edges of life. His speech tends to be plain and unpretentious, though it can crack with youthful passion when provoked.",
  "appearance": "Described as thick-set with large hands and feet, Jim has a sturdier, more unpolished look compared to his sister\u2019s refined appearance. His clothes are ill-fitting and rough, underscoring his working-class background and his discomfort with the more delicate trappings of theatrical life. His physical presence is that of a practical, no-nonsense youth rather than a dandy.",
