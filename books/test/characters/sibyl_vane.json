  "description": "Sibyl is a talented albeit tragically flawed actress whose beauty and initial promise make her irresistible to Dorian. Once seen as the embodiment of artistic and emotional purity, her subsequent onstage performance reveals a disconnect between her earlier brilliance and her current state.",
  "personality": "Sibyl is deeply passionate and romantic, living for the intensity of her art. She is imaginative and idealistic, having once fully embraced her stage persona as a true manifestation of love and life. However, her sensitivity also renders her vulnerable; when confronted with the reality of critical failure and personal rejection, she becomes desperate, emotionally volatile, and excessively self-critical. Her longing for true emotion contrasts sharply with her growing disillusionment with the artificiality of the theatre.",
  "voice": "Her voice is described as \u2018exquisite\u2019 and musical, capable of captivating an audience when portraying the idealized characters of the stage. However, it can also betray a certain affected quality\u2014artificial and declamatory\u2014when her performance lacks genuine emotion. The modulation of her voice shifts from delicate and dreamy in moments of onstage glory to tremulous and pleading in private moments with Dorian.",
  "appearance": "Sibyl is depicted as extraordinarily lovely, carrying a delicate, almost fawn-like grace. Her features suggest both vulnerability and a shimmering, otherworldly beauty: shy, startled eyes; a slight blush reminiscent of a rose\u2019s hue; and hands described as cool and delicate like ivory. Even her movement is compared to the graceful swaying of a plant in water\u2014ethereal and subtly compelling, yet hinting at a fragility that echoes her emotional state.",
