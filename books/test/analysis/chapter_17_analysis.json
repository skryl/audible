He observes the sordid life outside\u2014drunken brawls, public-houses closing, and ghostly street-lamps\u2014and internally repeats Lord Henry\u2019s dictum about curing the soul with the senses. His inner turmoil, guilt over past sins, and hunger for oblivion (opium) are all vividly evoked."

He enters a narrow hall and pulls aside a tattered green curtain, leading him into what seems to be a third-rate dancing saloon converted into an opium den, where dim light and a motley array of patrons hint at pervasive debauchery."

Reflecting on his own recent meetings and the ruin of a young life hinted at by Basil\u2019s previous reproach, he ruminates morosely on fate, guilt, and the relentless burden of one\u2019s actions as he moves deeper into the nocturnal urban landscape."
