      "summary": "In the richly described studio\u2014redolent with the scents of roses and lilac\u2014Basil Hallward is seen before his full-length portrait of a young, exquisitely beautiful man. Lord Henry reclines on a divan, smoking and observing the surroundings. The two engage in a dialogue about the portrait, its artistic significance, and why Basil refuses to exhibit the work despite its brilliance.

The scene closes as Basil implores that Dorian\u2019s mysterious influence on his art be safeguarded from the world\u2019s prying eyes, underscoring the deep personal connection he feels to the young man."
