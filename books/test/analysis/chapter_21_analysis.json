      "summary": "Dorian\u2019s attention turns to a carved mirror, gifted by Lord Henry long ago, around which delicate Cupids seem to dance. The mirror prompts recollection of a maddened letter from someone who adored him, steeping him in an intense mix of self-admiration and loathing. Overwhelmed by the thought that his own stunning beauty has brought ruin, he dramatically flings the mirror to the floor, shattering it into silver splinters."

In a moment of conflicted hope and despair, he resolves to examine the portrait\u2014hoping that, if his life turns pure, even the grotesque image might transform. Yet as he draws the purple drapery from the portrait, he is confronted with the unchanged, loathsome visage that reflects all his sins, leading him to question whether his motivations are rooted in genuine redemption or mere vanity."

The violent act is accompanied by an agonized cry and a resounding crash that startles the servants from their quarters. Soon, curious passersby, a policeman, and members of the household converge on the scene. As the investigation unfolds, they discover a dead, disfigured man in evening dress lying on the floor, a grim revelation that his life and soul have been irrevocably destroyed."
