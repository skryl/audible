      "summary": "At tea-time in the conservatory, Dorian Gray engages in witty repartee with the charming Duchess of Monmouth and the other guests. Amid the clink of delicate china and sparkling silver under the soft lamp-light, philosophical banter abounds. Lord Henry expounds on his ideas\u2014ranging from rebranding names to the merits of beauty, art, love, and morality\u2014while the Duchess, along with others like Lady Narborough, joins in the playful yet incisive conversation. The dialogue covers subjects from the symbolism of orchids to contrasting attitudes toward beauty and virtue."
