The room, with its high-panelled olive oak wainscoting, cream-coloured plasterwork ceiling, silk-adorned felt carpet and long-fringed Persian rugs, exuded quiet charm. On a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette by Clodion beside a delicate book bound for Margaret of Valois, while large blue china jars, parrot-tulips, and apricot streams of London summer light created an atmosphere of faded opulence.",

But you must not think I don\u2019t like good music. I adore it, but I am afraid of it. It makes me too romantic. I have simply worshipped pianists \u2013 two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells me. I don\u2019t know what it is about them. Perhaps it is that they are foreigners. They all are, ain\u2019t they? Even those that are born in England become foreigners after a time, don\u2019t they? It is so clever of them, and such a compliment to art. Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn\u2019t it? You have never been to any of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray? You must come. I can\u2019t afford orchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners. They make one\u2019s rooms look so picturesque. But here is Harry! Harry, I came in to look for you, to ask you something \u2013 I forget what it was \u2013 and I found Mr. Gray here. We have had such a pleasant chat about music. We have quite the same ideas.

You filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life. One evening around seven o\u2019clock, I set out in search of adventure. Wandering through grimy streets and grim little squares, I found myself in front of an absurd little theatre. A hideous Jew in an amazing waistcoat, with greasy ringlets and an enormous diamond on his soiled shirt, beckoned me to a stage-box for a guinea. Although I did not expect much, I was drawn into the performance. In that dilapidated private box, with a vulgar drop-scene and a tawdry play unfolding before me\u2014a grotesque version of Romeo and Juliet\u2014I saw, amidst the crude scenery and clashing sounds, a girl of exquisite loveliness. A girl hardly seventeen, with a delicate, flower-like face, plaited dark-brown hair, violet wells of passion and a voice that began as soft as a flute and rose like the wild passion of violins. I confess, Harry, as I watched her transform from Rosalind to Imogen and finally to Juliet, I was overcome by a profound sense of awe. Her every gesture and inflection captured something ineffable. In that dim theatre, I first experienced the tempest of desire; I realized that my heart had been seized by an art that transcends mere mortals.",
