      "summary": "In a powerful emotional climax, Dorian reacts with intense jealousy and despair upon realizing that while his portrait ages, he will remain forever youthful in appearance. This leads to a heated exchange between Dorian and Basil\u2014with Lord Henry\u2019s sardonic contributions adding to the tension. As tea is served and light banter resumes with plans to attend the theatre, the unresolved conflict lingers. Dorian\u2019s anguished vow to preserve his unchanging beauty and Basil\u2019s sorrowful resignation underscore the chapter\u2019s themes of art, beauty, and the inevitability of change."
