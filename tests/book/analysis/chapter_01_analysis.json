      "summary": "Here, the author emphasizes that art is simultaneously surface and symbol. It warns that attempting to peel back these layers\u2014whether by delving too deeply into literal symbolism or surface appearances\u2014is perilous, ultimately asserting that art mirrors the viewer rather than life itself."

This famous summation cements the idea that art, in its purest form, is inherently useless."
