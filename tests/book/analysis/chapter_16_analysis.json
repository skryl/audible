      "summary": "Dorian Gray arrives at eight-thirty at Lady Narborough\u2019s drawing-room. Although his nerves are throbbing, he displays calm grace as he greets his hostess. Lady Narborough, a shrewd and eccentric host, immediately favors Dorian, setting the stage for an evening filled with witty conversation and high-society charade. During the introductions, several tedious yet colorful guests make their presence known."

Lady Narborough and Lord Henry exchange humorous and provocative remarks on love, marriage, and society, while the conversation wanders to gossip about Madame de Ferrol and the vicissitudes of beautiful women. Dorian listens mostly in silence, his uncharacteristic abstention from food drawing comment as his internal tension mounts amid the sparkling repartee."

Lord Henry casually checks on Dorian\u2019s apparent disquiet and probes about his earlier departure from the party. Feeling increasingly out of place and troubled by the evening\u2019s events, Dorian eventually excuses himself, leaving the gathering behind."

      "summary": "Alone at home, Dorian\u2019s internal torment resurfaces. In his library, he methodically locks the door and turns to a secret press where he had hidden Basil Hallward\u2019s coat and bag. Consumed by a need to destroy dangerous reminders of his past, he sets the items aflame. His actions are intercut with a moment of strange fascination as he studies a majestic, mysterious cabinet. Unlocking it reveals an elaborately crafted Chinese box containing a green, waxy paste that evokes both longing and dread."

In Bond Street he hails a hansom cab, bargaining with the driver to speed him toward an undisclosed destination. This brief journey further underscores his restless internal state and the dark, secretive life he leads."
