      "summary": "On a cold, foggy November night, Dorian Gray is returning home from dinner when he unexpectedly encounters Basil Hallward on the street.

      "summary": "Dorian invites Basil into his home after the brief street encounter.

Their conversation begins on a casual, almost genial note as they exchange pleasantries and reminiscences."

      "summary": "The tone deepens as Basil shifts the conversation to more serious matters. He expresses concern over the vicious rumours and scandals circulating about Dorian\u2019s reputation in London, citing incidents involving various acquaintances. Basil\u2019s earnest and troubled tone contrasts with Dorian\u2019s petulant and indifferent responses, as Dorian defends himself against the allegations and dismisses the seriousness of the gossip."

In response, Dorian boldly declares that Basil will be allowed to \u2018see his soul\u2019\u2014a provocative challenge that shocks Basil. The heated exchange culminates in Dorian inviting Basil upstairs to review his diary, where Dorian implies that the truth about his life (and soul) is recorded, leaving an atmosphere of tension and defiance."
