The world called him selfish because he derived no particular benefit from his existence, yet Society considered him generous, as he fed the people who amused him. (His background, his father\u2019s capricious retirement from Madrid when not offered the Paris Embassy, and his own resignation from his father\u2019s service all contributed to the development of his artful pursuit of doing nothing at all.)",

Certainly. I remember the whole thing as if it happened yesterday. The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few months after the marriage. There was an ugly story about it. They said Kelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult his son-in-law in public \u2013 paid him, sir, to do it \u2013 and that the fellow spat on his man as if he had been a pigeon. The thing was hushed up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time afterwards. He brought his daughter back with him, I was told, and she never spoke to him again. Oh, yes; it was a bad business. The girl died, too, within a year. So she left a son, did she? I had forgotten that. What sort of boy is he?
