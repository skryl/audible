Tonight I am to dine with you, then attend the opera. How extraordinarily dramatic life is! If I had read these words in a book, I\u2019d have wept. But now that it has happened to me, it seems far too wondrous for tears. This is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written\u2014and it is addressed to a dead girl. Can the dead feel, I wonder? Oh, Harry, how I loved her once! It seems ages ago. Yet that dreadful night, when she performed so poorly that my heart nearly broke\u2026 I felt I had done wrong. And now she is dead. My God, Harry, what shall I do? You have no idea of the danger I am in.",

Had you married Sibyl, you would have been wretched, no matter how kindly you treated her.
