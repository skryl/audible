  "gender": "Male",
  "age": "Not explicitly stated (likely middle-aged)",
  "description": "The sensitive and talented artist whose portrait ignited Dorian\u2019s inner descent. Basil is remembered for the deep moral impression his art and words left on Dorian, and though he has disappeared by this point, his influence and the burden of his testimony persist.",
  "personality": "Thoughtful, earnest, and deeply committed to his art. His sensibility and moral seriousness are evident, and even in his silence, his past words seem to carry a weight of reprimand and sorrow. He appears both admirable and, in Dorian's eyes, a figure partly responsible for the destruction of innocence.",
  "voice": "Inferred as cultured and measured, with a warm yet somber timbre that reflects his passionate dedication to art and truth. His speech likely carried gentle inflections and earnest emotion.",
  "appearance": "Not described in vivid detail in this chapter, but one may imagine him with a refined, sensitive face marked by the intensity of an artist. He would probably be dressed in a manner befitting a serious gentleman with an artistic temperament, perhaps modest and unflashy yet with an unmistakable air of refinement.",
